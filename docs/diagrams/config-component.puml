[ConfigManager] as CM

' Providers - local or remote
component "LocalConfigProvider" as LCP
component "RemoteConfigProvider" as RCP

' Watchers - local or remote
component "LocalConfigWatcher" as LCW
component "RemoteConfigWatcher" as RCW

' External components
database "Config File (.synx.yaml)" as CF
rectangle "Viper" as V
rectangle "Logger (zap.Logger)" as LOG
cloud "Remote Services\n(e.g., Consul, etcd)" as RS

' Relationships
CM --> LCP : uses (default provider)
CM --> RCP : uses (if remoteProvider configured)
CM --> LCW : uses (default watcher)
CM --> RCW : uses (if remoteProvider & watch enabled)
LCP ..> CF : reads file
LCP ..> V : unmarshals config
LCW ..> V : monitors file changes
RCP ..> RS : fetches remote config
RCP ..> V : unmarshals remote config
RCW ..> RS : polls remote service
CM --> LOG : logs events

note right of CM
  ConfigManager reloads configuration on change.
  Remote components are used when a remote provider is configured.
end note
